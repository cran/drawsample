#' @title  Draw Samples with the Desired Properties from a Data Set
#'
#'
#' @description \pkg{draw_sample}, function takes a sample of the specified
#' sample size,#' skewness, and kurtosis form a data set (dist)with or without
#' resampling.
#' Fleishman's power method (\doi{10.1007/BF02293811})  was used
#' for the desired skewness and kurtosis level.
#' Therefore, the coefficient of skewness can be chosen between 0 and 3.6.
#' Although the kurtosis coefficient varies for each skewness coefficient
#' and varies from -1.2 and 20.
#' If convenient kurtosis and skew values are not provided,
#' no solutions can be found and an error is given.
